SDN-WISE & ONOS
====================================

### What is SDN-WISE?
[SDN-WISE](http://sdn-wise.dieei.unict.it) is a Software Defined Networking solution for WIreless SEnsor Networks.
The aim of SDN-WISE is to simplify the management of the network, 
the development of novel applications, and the experimentation of new networking solutions. 

### What is ONOS?
[ONOS](http://www.onosproject.org) is a new SDN network operating system designed for high availability,
performance, scale-out.

This repository contains a fork of ONOS enriched with the software modules needed to interact with SDN-WISE networks.

* To emulate an heterogeneous networks using SDN-WISE, ONOS, and Mininet please check this [tutorial](http://sdn-wise.dieei.unict.it/docs/guides/GetStartedONOS.html).
* To try SDN-WISE on real devices download `sdn-wise-contiki` from [here](https://github.com/sdnwiselab/sdn-wise-contiki) and check the README for details on how to build SDN-WISE and Contiki.
